# Oscillating Water Column

**Authors:** Mohamed Shabara, Jeff Grasberger and Jorge Leon-Quiroga

**Geometry:** Floating OWC Rigid Body Approach

**Original Version:** WEC-Sim v6.1.2

**Description:**

This model simulates a Floating Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device using a rigid-body approach. 
It incorporates performance curves for both a Wells Turbine and a generator, providing a realistic 
representation of their dynamic behavior. Additionally, the model accounts for the presence of a
 mooring system to ensure the stability of the floating body.

An optimal control strategy is implemented to maximize turbine efficiency by dynamically adjusting system parameters based on operating speed.
