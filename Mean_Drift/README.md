# Mean Drift

**Author:**  	Thanh Toan Tran

**Geometry:**	Floating hemisphere with 1 m radius

**Original Version:** 	WEC-Sim v4.4

**Description**

Example using the mean drift function provided by WEC-Sim, refer to mean drift theory [documentation ](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/theory/theory.html#sinusoidal-steady-state-response) for more information. In this WEC-Sim applications case there are two folders: 1) WAMIT and 2) WECSim. The WAMIT folder contains an example set of the required input files that allow WAMIT to calculate the mean drift forces with the corresponding output files. The WECSim folder includes a working WECSim model of a heaving hemisphere that includes mean drift forcing.
