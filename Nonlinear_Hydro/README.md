# Nonlinear Hydro

**Author:**  	Yi-Hsiang Yu and Kelley Ruehl

**Geometry:**	Ellipsoid

**Original Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Description**	

Example using [Nonlinear Hydro](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) to run WEC-Sim for a heaving ellipsoid. Includes examples of running non-linear hydrodynamics with different [fixed and variable time-step solvers](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/advanced_features.html#time-step-features) (ode4/ode45), and different regular wave formulations (with/without CIC). Execute the `runNL.m` script to run this case.
