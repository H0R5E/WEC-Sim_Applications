# Mooring

**Author:**  	Yi-Hsiang Yu

**Geometry:**	RM3

**Original Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Dependencies:**	MoorDyn

**Description**

One example using the RM3 geometry coupled with MoorDyn to simulate a more realistic mooring system. And another example modeling the RM3 with a Mooring Matrix. The MoorDyn application consists of 3 catenary mooring lines attached to floating buoys and then to different points on the spar and anchored at the sea floor.
