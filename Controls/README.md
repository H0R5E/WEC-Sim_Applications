Examples using WEC-Sim with controls

* Declutching - control with optimal declutching time
* Latching - control with optimal latching time
* MPC - model predictive controller (MPC)
* Passive (P) - control with optimal proportional gain
* Reactive (PI) - control with optimal proportional and integral gains
* Reactive with PTO - reactive controller and simple direct drive power take-off (PTO)
