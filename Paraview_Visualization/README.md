# Paraview Visualization

**Author:**  	Carlos Michelen and Alan Moore

**Geometry**	OSWEC and RM3

**Original Version:** 	WEC-Sim v4.2 

**Dependencies:**	
* Paraview 5.11.1

**Description**

The **RM3_MoorDyn_Viz** example uses ParaView for WEC-Sim data visualization of a WEC-Sim model coupled with [MoorDyn](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/advanced_features.html#moordyn) to simulate a mooring system for the RM3. This WEC-Sim example consists of 3 catenary mooring lines attached to different points on the spar, and anchored at the sea floor.   

The **OSWEC_NonLinear_Viz** example uses ParaView for WEC-Sim data visualization of a WEC-Sim model with [Non-linear Hydro](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) to simulate non-linear wave excitation on the flap of the OSWEC geometry. This example uses Non-linear Hydro to model wave loading on the flap, and Non-Hydro Body to model the base of the OSWEC.
